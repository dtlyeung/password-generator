# Password Generator

This project is for the UofT SCS Coding Bootcamp.
It focuses on the use of Javascript in order to generate a random password for the user according to accepted criteria.
Unfortunately, at this moment in time, the application does not return a password and still needs some more work to 
get it functioning correctly.
